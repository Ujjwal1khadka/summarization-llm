      "1. Adding Clients: Users can add individual clients or groups by filling out an online form and selecting the client type (Primary, Dependent, Group, Group Member).\n",
      "2. Managing Memberships: Users can approve, decline, modify, or cancel memberships, and adjust membership dates.\n",

Clients have additional functionalities accessible under the ellipsis menu, including editing profiles, approving or declining memberships, and modifying memberships.

Membership approval is necessary for transactions to proceed, and clients are initially placed in a submitted status upon creation. Approved clients receive a receipt and welcome email, while declined clients receive an email with notes. If approval occurs 7 days after enrollment, the client is not charged immediately but on the next payment date. Membership can be modified only when approved, allowing changes to fees, dates, and status. Memberships can be added or canceled through specific steps in the client module, and start or end dates can be adjusted as needed. Transactions can be manually added, and agreements can be sent for signatures. Client statuses include submitted, approved, canceled, declined, active, and inactive. For further assistance or missing functionalities, contact Vitafy support. Clients can activate their accounts through an invite sent from the client module, which pre-populates their sign-up page with their email.\n"

      "The Vitafy Healthcare system's Clients Module is designed to manage two main types of clients: Individuals and Groups. Individuals include single customers, families, or retail clients, while Groups consist of employers, companies, or associations. The system provides tools to manage client information, oversee service or case details, handle memberships, and conduct transactions. Users can add both individual clients and groups, along with dependents or group members, and manage various aspects such as billing, membership approvals, and document uploads.\n",
      "\n",
      "For individual clients, the process involves selecting the client type (Primary or Dependent), filling out necessary personal and contact details, and choosing service offerings and billing options. Similarly, adding a group involves inputting group details, selecting membership types, and setting up billing information. Both processes allow for the uploading and management of files and viewing of client ID cards if enabled. The system defaults client status to \"Submitted\" and charges are applied once approved. This streamlined approach ensures efficient management of client data and services within the Vitafy Healthcare system.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vitafy Healthcare system offers a comprehensive client management portal that caters to both individual and group clients. The system allows for the addition and management of personal details, service bundles, billing information, and document uploads for both client types. Clients are initially set to a \"Submitted\" status and are only charged upon approval. The approval process is straightforward, involving selection from an ellipsis menu. Additionally, group members can be added by accessing the group tab, selecting the appropriate group, and filling out the required information in a form similar to that used for creating the group itself.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system also features a Client Quick View function, which provides a snapshot of a client's enrollments, billing transactions, and active cases, enhancing the ease of management and oversight. This function is accessible via a simple click on a plus sign next to the client's name. Furthermore, billing information can be updated through the client's profile, where multiple payment methods can be managed and set as primary.\n",
      "\n",
      "Additional functionalities within the client ellipsis menu include editing client profiles, approving or declining memberships, and modifying memberships once approved. These tools ensure flexible and efficient management of client details and memberships. The system also handles notifications, sending receipts and welcome emails upon approval, or explanatory emails if a membership is declined. If approval occurs seven days after enrollment, the client is not charged immediately but on the next scheduled payment date, requiring manual transaction addition for the first payment. This comprehensive system supports effective administration of healthcare services and client relationships in Vitafy's healthcare environment.\n",
      "\n",
      "The Vitafy Healthcare system provides a robust client management portal that allows for comprehensive handling of both individual and group memberships. Users can view active and past memberships, and have the flexibility to modify these by changing start dates or updating membership details. Adding a new membership involves navigating to the client's profile, selecting the modify option, and choosing from available membership bundles, which can be set as public or private. Similarly, existing memberships can be canceled or have their start and end dates adjusted as needed.\n",
      "\n",
      "The system also supports manual transactions for clients, sending agreements for signatures, and activating client accounts for login purposes. Clients can be invited to activate their accounts through the system, and if necessary, a second invite can be sent if the first is misplaced. The client statuses within the system include Submitted, Approved, Canceled, Declined, Active, and Inactive, each reflecting the current state of the client's engagement with the healthcare services.\n",

For individual clients, the system allows the addition of primary or dependent members, requiring details such as personal information, service selections, and billing preferences. Group clients, encompassing employers and associations, are managed similarly with capabilities to add group details, membership types, and manage billing setups. Both client types can upload documents, view ID cards, and their status is set to \"Submitted\" upon entry, with charges applied post-approval.\n",
      "\n",
      "The portal also features a Client Quick View for easy access to a client‚Äôs enrollments, transactions, and cases, alongside functionalities to update billing information and manage payment methods.

Notifications such as receipts and welcome emails are sent automatically upon membership approval, with manual transaction addition required if approval is delayed.\n",

      "Additionally, the system supports viewing and modifying active and past memberships, handling manual transactions, sending agreements for signatures, and activating client accounts for login purposes. Clients can only receive account invitations if their enrollment is approved.
